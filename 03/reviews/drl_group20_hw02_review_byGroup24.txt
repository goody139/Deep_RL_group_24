Review of Homework 02 of Group 20:

Review by group 24

Task 01:

The following categories are required according to the task sheet:
At least 5x5 size: Yes

Some tiles are blocked: Yes, some tiles are blocked 
Exactly one tile is positive: Yes only one state is positive
Mutiple tiles negative reward: Yes
For the above three categories you implemented these in a way, that you just initialize these values correctly when creating the gridworld, which is a totally valid for the scope of this task. One way you could still improve this, is with a check in the constructor.

Fixed starting point: (0,0) Yes
Non-deterministic state transition: Yes, good. Also with a check for possible actions and if the agent tries to leave the field in all directions.

Object representing gridworld: Yes

The gridworld is randomly or fixed: fixed and hard-coded

Methods reset(), step(), visualize(): Yes


Task 02:
n-step SARSA: Yes
The solution is prepared to solve the task for any N: 1-Step SARSA is possible, Monte Carlo seems to be also possible with a large enough N
Visualization of Q-values: Yes


Summary: Your solution is really good: You fulfilled all the requirements and the code seems to work.
We especially like your coding style as you use self-explanatory variable names. 
However, some parts of your code could benefit from a little bit more commentary.
