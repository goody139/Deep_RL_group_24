Your work on the assignments is very good. Even though this was not really a problem in homework 1, if future assignments should require some more mathematical
formulas the solutions should be saved in a document, which allows for more layouting, as to improve readability.Task 2 is pretty much perfect, task 3 is also
very well done, maybe the discussion could have been a little more indepth. Your solution for task 1 is also good.
