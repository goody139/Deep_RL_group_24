Feedback for Homework 03 by group 24:

- looks like a perfect solution

Good: - You implemented Delayed DQN
      - with Polyak Averaging
      - Multithreading?!
      - small network with 2 hidden layers
      - good error handling
      - experience replay buffer: FIFO, tf.Dataset	
      - very good, explanatory comments
      - according to the result graph you uploaded the DQN learns quite well and the lander achieves
      at least 0 return on average
